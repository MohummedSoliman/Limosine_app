# Limosine_app
This proposal is for a Limousine Company, it has it’s own drivers & cars.
The Company creates specific journeys such as:-
1- Cairo. 2- Alexandria. 3- Aswan.
I created three classes for main module:-
1- Client. 2- Driver. 3-Journey.
And created a class for the relation between client and journey.
The Client’s class specifies client information name, email, and phone.
The Driver’s class specifies driver information name, phone.
The Journey’s class specifies journey information place, driver_name, and
price.
I saved some default information about all this classes in arrays.
The app flow:-
1- Asks the user if he/she is a new client or not?
2- If the client types N then the app asks to enter his/her name.
3- The app appears greeting statement and displays available journeys.
4- The client enters journey’s name.
5- The app displays information about this journey that was saved
previously in the journey’s object matches this name.
6- The app saves this journey in array that saves the relation between client
and journeys.
7- The app collects all journeys price for that client
8- If that total reaches 2000 results the app displays message encourage
client to make more journeys and displays discount and total after applying
discount.
9- If the client types Y then the app asks to enter the data to save in array
of client’s object. (Also makes the same cycle if the client types N.)

made maximum profit.
